## Current Coverage

### CP-31 800 Sheet
A collection of 800-rated problems from Codeforces for systematic practice:
- Ambitious Kid
- Cover in Water
- Don't Try to Count
- Doremy's Paint 3
- Game with Integers
- Goals of Victory
- Halloumi Boxes
- How Much Does Daytona Cost
- Jagged Swaps
- Line Trip
- United We Stand
- Sequence Game (B)

### Number Theory

- Prime numbers
- Sieve of Eratosthenes
- Counting primes
- Nth prime
- Almost primes
- T-primes
- GCD (Euclidean Algorithm)
- Common greatest divisor
- Counting divisors
- Sum of divisors
- Number theory based competitive programming problems

All solutions are written with competitive programming constraints in mind.

## Tech Stack

- Programming Language: C++
- Focus: Optimized, readable, and reusable implementations
