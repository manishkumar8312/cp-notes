A structured repository containing Competitive Programming notes and optimized implementations.  
The repository is designed for concept clarity, efficient problem solving, and quick revision for contests and interviews.

## Current Coverage

### CP-31 800 Sheet
A collection of 800-rated problems from Codeforces for systematic practice:
- Cover in Water
- Doremy's Paint 3
- Game with Integers
- Halloumi Boxes
- Jagged Swaps
- Line Trip

### Number Theory

- Prime numbers
- Sieve of Eratosthenes
- Counting primes
- Nth prime
- Almost primes
- T-primes
- GCD (Euclidean Algorithm)
- Common greatest divisor
- Counting divisors
- Sum of divisors
- Number theory based competitive programming problems

All solutions are written with competitive programming constraints in mind.

## Tech Stack

- Programming Language: C++
- Focus: Optimized, readable, and reusable implementations
